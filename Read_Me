A mistake I encountered in production is like:
I try to send a json message to the server, and the json in the <input> is like
{"name" : "Chen"}
However, once get the text from the <input> using 
var jsonObject = $(input).val();
after that you use JSON.stringify(jsonObject) to turn it into a json string
But unfortunately, the json string looks like this:
"{\"name\" : \"Chen\"}"
which makes springboot's jackson unable to handle the request.
The thing you need to know is that, $(input).val(); is already a json string,
not a javascript object, so you don't need to turn it into a json string again.
